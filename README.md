:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: PVZ walnuts++ == Nuggets<br>
* Funny graphics, trying to make up!

### Inspiration
* Build things, Break things, Fix things, Learn Loop...

### Motivation
* This project would be in construction mode as I gather things to update..(Hope to update as I progress!)
* Hopefully this project becomes my reference manual. Trying to avoid loosing stuff.
* Trying to document or blog resources/learnings I go over computer security.
* Prevent from loosing stuff already explored to make things easier (Multiple machines, Drive!)
* Beating the `there is not enough time` scenario to keep track and blog exploration in security!
* I love to manually write things down, take notes.. Track Notes!!!
