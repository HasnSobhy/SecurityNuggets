# Method
* Reading the source code and meddling with the application
* Recon:
  - We could post any payload to the application and we can see our posts. Also there is a report to admin feature to report to admin --> ( Source code makes it evident that this page will be visited by an admin ), Also the challenge says flag is in the cookie
* Attack Strategy
  - We create a XSS payload that gets executed and we report this page with payload to the admin. When admin visits we need to transfer cookie to our command and control server
  - Setup:
    - have a simple http server exposed on a public endpoint (reachable through internet) that receives and reads out the request
    - use ngrok to expose
* Important Hacks
  - bypass CSP and make the malicius xss payload script executable
  - Script to read and transfer cookie to a server to be read
* Got JSONP vulnerbility in callback from this article and csp evaluator ( *.google.com )
  - Simple payload on callback works ( alert() )
  - Generate a payload that works and sends the cookie to the c&c server
