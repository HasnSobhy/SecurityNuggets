Notes: 
  * Unrelated research
    - Mobef ransomware trojan 
    - Encrypts all the sensitive info files (predefined file extensions) with RSA 2048 AES CBC 
    - Reference: https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-mobef-virus/
    - Changes wallpaper into a ransom note
    - Delievered by: 
      * Email
  * So, Mobef ransomware encrypted file...Decrypt it?
  * neverLan website --> Creators --> N30 (Given in the problem) --> Track N30 in twitter (as no github was given) --> Get real name --> Search + Goto Github account --> Owner of neverLanCtf so we are on right path --> Keyz project --> Make project --> Read readme --> Operating with --n worked giving some values --> It stores key value pairs so we want flag --> get flag
